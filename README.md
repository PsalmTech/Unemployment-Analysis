# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## 📌 Overview

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which represents the number of unemployed individuals as a percentage of the total labor force. During the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment rates surged globally. This project analyzes unemployment trends using Python, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes unemployment statistics across different regions and time periods.

Columns in the Dataset:

Region – The geographical area (state/province).

Date – The recorded date.

Frequency – Monthly data records.

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%) – The estimated percentage of unemployed individuals.

Estimated Employed – The estimated number of employed individuals.

Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%) – The labor force participation rate.

Area – Rural or Urban classification.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Google Colab (for execution)


## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key Insights:

✔️ Unemployment rate trends over time
✔️ Distribution of unemployment rates
✔️ Comparison of unemployment rates by region and area (Urban/Rural)
